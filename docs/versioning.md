# Versioning
This project uses the following the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
Every time the major version changes a new codename is defined; I'm choosing the codenames from the Star Wars
galaxy [planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_planets_and_moons).

For every release (minor, version or fix) a new tag is created from the master branch.
